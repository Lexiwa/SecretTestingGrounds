List of shit we should/could get working on at some point in time

Add/remove things accordingly. More things will most likely be added/elaborated upon.
The first list is a mix between bare necessities (@) and general ideas (*).

- Combat.
  @sword/dagger/melee in general: create sword/thing in front of player's face,
  play animation, check collisions, disable object
  @magic/ranged: create projectile, give speed, check collisions and deal damage.
  *potentially knockback as well if we can figure that out. 
  *charge attacks?
  
- More interface stuff
  @quest log interface
  @profile screen (stats, inventory) 
  @stats for nerds (HP, mana, stamina, etc)
  
- Sprites (scenery is flowing like the amazon river, fast and furious. we just need other stuff)
  @weapons
  @enemies, or at least enemy
  
- Animation for characters
  @walking
  @animation
  
note to selves: learn how to animate spritesheets and program well. fuck.
